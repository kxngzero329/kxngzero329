# Shuhair Smith

I am a 20-year-old aspiring software developer seeking an entry-level position that provides me with opportunities for on-the-job learning and skill refinement.
My educational background includes the successful completion of a comprehensive software development course at CodeSpace Academy. Proficient in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, 
and the React framework (utilizing Vite for enhanced support), I bring a strong foundation in front-end development to the table.

My dedication and work ethic, evident throughout my academic journey, reflect my eagerness to tackle challenges head-on. 
I am well-versed in independent learning and committed to continually expanding my skillset by mastering new programming languages. 
This drive to evolve as a software developer makes me a dependable and adaptable asset in any professional setting.
